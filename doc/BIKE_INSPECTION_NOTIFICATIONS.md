# Slack Notifications for Bike Build Inspection

This document explains the Slack notification system that alerts when bikes are ready for inspection and when inspections are completed.

## Overview

The system automatically sends Slack notifications at two key points in the bike build process:

1. **Build Complete**: When all build tasks are completed and the bike is ready for quality inspection
2. **Inspection Complete**: When the build & inspection phase is finished and the bike is ready for customer delivery

## Implementation Details

### Components Modified

- **BuildStep.tsx**: Enhanced with automatic Slack notifications
- **notificationService.ts**: Service layer for Slack integration
- **useSlackNotifications.ts**: React hook for easy notification usage
- **SlackNotificationTester.tsx**: Development testing component

### Notification Triggers

#### 1. Build Ready for Inspection

**When:** All 18 build tasks are completed (checkboxes checked)
**Message Format:**

```
üîß **Bike Build Completed - Ready for Inspection**

üìç **Bike:** Trek Mountain Bike (ID: BIKE-001)
üÜî **Transaction:** #TRANS-123
üë®‚Äçüîß **Built by:** John Smith
‚è∞ **Completed:** 9/11/2025, 2:30:00 PM

üîç **Next Step:** Quality inspection required before customer delivery
üìã **Location:** Check build area for completed bike

*Please inspect the bike and verify all build tasks are completed to quality standards.*
```

#### 2. Inspection Complete

**When:** User clicks "Proceed to Customer Creation" button after all tasks are done
**Message Format:**

```
‚úÖ **Bike Inspection Completed - Ready for Customer**

üìç **Bike:** Trek Mountain Bike (ID: BIKE-001)
üÜî **Transaction:** #TRANS-123
üë®‚Äçüîß **Inspected by:** John Smith
‚è∞ **Completed:** 9/11/2025, 2:35:00 PM
üìù **Notes:** All systems checked and working properly.

üéâ **Status:** Bike is ready for customer pickup/delivery
üìã **Next Step:** Customer notification and scheduling

*Bike has passed all quality checks and is ready for customer handover.*
```

## Technical Implementation

### Service Layer

The `notificationService.ts` provides methods for:

- `notifyBuildReadyForInspection()`: Send build completion notification
- `notifyInspectionCompleted()`: Send inspection completion notification
- `sendSlackNotification()`: Send custom notifications
- `testSlackIntegration()`: Test the Slack connection

### React Hook

The `useSlackNotifications` hook provides:

- Loading states for UI feedback
- Error handling that doesn't block workflow
- Easy-to-use methods for components

### Error Handling

- Notifications are non-blocking - failures won't prevent workflow progression
- Errors are logged to console for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks if backend is unavailable
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

## Backend Requirements

For the notifications to work, the backend must implement the endpoints described in `SLACK_WEBHOOK_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`:

- `POST /notifications/slack-notification`: Send notifications
- `POST /notifications/slack-test`: Test integration (dev only)

## Development Testing

Use the `SlackNotificationTester` component to test notifications:

```tsx
import SlackNotificationTester from "./components/SlackNotificationTester";

// Add to your development routes or admin page
<SlackNotificationTester />;
```

The tester provides:

- Integration test button
- Custom message sending
- Pre-built notification type tests
- Results display with success/error feedback

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The notification service expects the backend API at:

- Development: `http://localhost:3000` (default)
- Production: Configure via environment variables

### Slack Channel Setup

Notifications are sent to the Slack channel configured in the backend webhook URL. The backend team should configure:

- Webhook URL for the target channel
- Appropriate channel permissions
- Message formatting preferences

## Usage in Code

### Automatic Notifications (Already Implemented)

The BuildStep component automatically sends notifications when:

- All build tasks are completed
- User advances to the next workflow step

### Manual Notifications

```tsx
import { useSlackNotifications } from "../hooks/useSlackNotifications";

const { notifyBuildReady, notifyInspectionComplete } = useSlackNotifications();

// Notify build is ready for inspection
await notifyBuildReady(bikeId, transactionId, mechanicName, bikeModel);

// Notify inspection is complete
await notifyInspectionComplete(
  bikeId,
  transactionId,
  inspectorName,
  bikeModel,
  notes
);
```

### Custom Messages

```tsx
const { sendNotification } = useSlackNotifications();

await sendNotification(
  "üö® Urgent: Special bike request needs immediate attention"
);
```

## Error Scenarios Handled

1. **Backend Unavailable**: Logs warning, continues workflow
2. **Invalid Webhook**: Logs error, provides fallback message
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implements retry with backoff
4. **Network Issues**: Graceful timeout and error handling
5. **Missing Data**: Uses fallback values for bike info

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Alerts**: Mechanics know immediately when bikes need inspection
2. **Workflow Efficiency**: Reduces delays between build and inspection phases
3. **Quality Control**: Ensures inspection step isn't skipped
4. **Transparency**: Team visibility into build progress
5. **Documentation**: Automatic logging of completion times and responsible parties

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:

- Email fallback if Slack is unavailable
- SMS notifications for urgent cases
- Integration with calendar systems for scheduling
- Analytics dashboard for build/inspection timing
- Customer notifications when bikes are ready
- Integration with inventory management systems

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Notifications Not Sending**

   - Check browser console for error messages
   - Verify backend is running and accessible
   - Test with SlackNotificationTester component

2. **Messages Not Appearing in Slack**

   - Verify webhook URL is correctly configured
   - Check Slack channel permissions
   - Ensure webhook is not rate limited

3. **Build Tasks Not Triggering Notifications**
   - Verify all 18 tasks are marked complete
   - Check browser console for completion detection logs
   - Ensure transaction has valid bike and user data

### Debug Steps

1. Open browser developer tools
2. Check console logs for notification attempts
3. Use Network tab to verify API calls
4. Test with SlackNotificationTester component
5. Check backend logs for webhook delivery status

For additional support, refer to:

- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for backend setup
- `FRONTEND_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed API usage
- Browser console logs for real-time debugging information
